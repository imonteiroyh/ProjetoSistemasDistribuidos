# Distributed System Projects
 
Project_1 was an introductory project aimed at training and verifying the practical implementation of some tools, such as a calculator, a chat, and a smart environment, without the help of frameworks. Meanwhile, Project_2 involved creating three actuators and three sensors that were connected and exchanging information to simulate a more sophisticated smart home environment, using tools like gRPC and RabbitMQ.
